Through scoping, workshops and audience research the project seeks to establish best practice and to provide technical recommendations for the development of a national approach to the visualisation and discovery of &lsquo;digital collections&rsquo;. By this we mean simply the electronic records of cultural heritage (for example of objects, documents, sites or buildings), which may be in the form of digitised content, structured data, metadata, or pointers to web pages. </p><p><em>Locating a National Collection</em> (LaNC) seeks to derive value for visitors, research, and conservation, by working with Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums (so-called GLAMs) and with other institutions and individuals, including those that manage the Historic Environment. The project builds on methodologies developed by <em><a href=\"https://pelagios.org/\">The Pelagios Network</a></em> of researchers, scientists and curators. It will develop understanding within the cultural heritage sector of how location-based interfaces can be used to make collections meaningful, driving content-discovery beyond mere text-based searching and towards visualisation.</p>",

These pages either refer to the same visitor site, another location in the vicinity of the site or have another geographical connection. The map is therefore the beginning of a journey through the UK’s wealth of cultural heritage.</p><h2>What was involved in making the map</h2><p>VisitPlus was first shown to focus groups that were representative of the UK public to gain feedback. A powerpoint slide encapsulated the concept by focusing on the National Trust’s and English Heritage’s visitor sites at Lindisfarne, asking the public if they would be interested in accessing connected records like the British Library’s Lindisfarne Gospels after a visit.</p><p>The reaction was positive as audiences appreciated that diverse and high quality resources were made accessible from a single point of access. The ‘VisitPlus’ branding was somewhat problematic however as audiences felt the name implied the map should only be used on-site and was an inadequate replacement for a guidebook. In short, the name obscured the broad range of use cases that were possible.</p><p>Underlying VisitPlus is a gazetteer of UK heritage visitor locations numbering in the low thousands and typically defined as of national significance. Each location acts as a nexus, an entry point to access many other collection items. Web pages were assigned coordinates in the form of latitude and longitude based on locations that they mention or represent. Connections were drawn computationally between those that were geographically close and that had similar names.</p>",

    "title":"<b>Locating a National Collection - Heritage for All</b>",
    "content":"<p><big><b><i>Heritage for All</i> helps the public to explore the parts of collections that are connected to familiar locations such as the ‘place where they live’, ‘places they remember’ or ‘places which they identify with’.</b></big></p><p>An area of east London has been selected for this map in order to test an approach to presenting collections at a local scale. The map does not stick to a single theme or collection type but rather includes diverse collections such as literary references, buildings and monuments. The consolidation of diverse collections is intended to offer opportunities for unexpected co-contextualisation and serendipitous discovery. Literary references might align with the buildings to which they refer, while exploring this neighbourhood in an open-ended way offers a similar feel to social media such as a Facebook feed or TikTok ‘for you’ feed.</p><p>Connections between records and familiar locations bring collections to life, piquing the interest of users and rendering objects significant. East London was selected as it is an urban area with large numbers of Portable Antiquities Scheme finds. The majority of the finds have been recovered from the foreshore of the River Thames. The map will appeal most to those who are familiar with this area, a trait that extends beyond where people currently reside to encompass locations drawn from memory, genealogy and other forms of identity. The map therefore acts as a pilot outlining what might be possible, with the long-term aspiration to extend the coverage nationwide.</p><figure class=\"figure\"><div class=\"iframe-wrapper\"><iframe src=\"https://britishlibrary.github.io/peripleo-lanc/hfa/#/?/?/?/mode=points+facet=organisation\" title=\"Heritage for All\"></iframe></div><figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Heritage for All: East London Case Study.</figcaption></figure><h2>What you can do with the map</h2><p>The map displays a large number of points in a relatively small geographical area and users who are familiar with east London will get the most out of the map. Points represent collection items and by clicking on a point the user can click through to a web page that provides more information on the item. Unlike some of the other maps, <i>Heritage for All</i> offers a single link for each item:</p><ul><li>If you are familiar with east London, zoom in on a street you have visited or an address you know.</li><li>If you are unfamiliar or want to try something different try looking for patterns in the points on the map. Why are there so many points along the river in an unusual pattern?</li><li>Open the filters by clicking on the icon in the top left, does the colour of the points offer any clues? Click on a point in the river and open the web page, can you find out why here?</li></ul><h2>What was involved in making the map</h2><p>Like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://britishlibrary.github.io/locating-a-national-collection/VisitPlus.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>VisitPlus</i></a>, <i>Heritage for All</i> was shown to focus groups that were representative of the UK public to gain feedback. A slide that illustrated the concept showed a London borough populated with picture and text previews of content such as findspots of ancient coins, extant and disappeared historic buildings, archival documents and literary references. Much of this heritage might be defined as ‘locally’ not ‘nationally’ significant. Participants greeted the potential for discovery and adventure through visits enthusiastically, commenting on the potential to inspire younger audiences where terms such as ‘disappeared’ or ‘vanished monuments and buildings’ piqued interest. A perceived drawback came in the platform’s potential for repeat usage, some asked why return after a handful of familiar places had been explored? However, the overriding response was that users found diverse collections connected to familiar locations hugely compelling. The passionate feedback <i>Heritage for All</i> evoked was likely influenced by renewed interest in local exploration resulting from travel restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic in place at the time the focus groups were held.</p><p><i>Heritage for All</i> adopted a model akin to a Geographical Information System for the presentation of heritage whereby each location represents a single record. Focus groups demonstrated that the appeal of the map lies in connecting heritage to precise locations in a familiar physical environment. Toponyms that refer to a city or settlement don’t provide this level of precision. Creating a map like <i>Heritage for All</i> relies on collections with existing coordinates or geographical information such as addresses, grid references or postcodes. Whilst data managed by historic environment organisations often contain coordinates, data from GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) do not. Furthermore, the approach applies more readily to urban areas - where a density of cultural heritage is available - than to rural areas.</p><h2>Datasets and acknowledgments</h2><p>The map contains the following datasets:</p><ul><li>British Library (thanks to Victoria Morris)</li><li>Historic England Certificates of immunity</li><li>Historic England Heritage at risk</li><li>Historic England Listed buildings</li><li>Historic England Parks and gardens</li><li>Historic England Scheduled monuments</li><li>Historic England World heritage sites</li><li>Open Plaques (thanks to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://openplaques.org/data\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://openplaques.org/data</a>)</li><li>Portable Antiquities Scheme</li></ul>",
