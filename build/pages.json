Through scoping, workshops and audience research the project seeks to establish best practice and to provide technical recommendations for the development of a national approach to the visualisation and discovery of &lsquo;digital collections&rsquo;. By this we mean simply the electronic records of cultural heritage (for example of objects, documents, sites or buildings), which may be in the form of digitised content, structured data, metadata, or pointers to web pages. </p><p><em>Locating a National Collection</em> (LaNC) seeks to derive value for visitors, research, and conservation, by working with Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums (so-called GLAMs) and with other institutions and individuals, including those that manage the Historic Environment. The project builds on methodologies developed by <em><a href=\"https://pelagios.org/\">The Pelagios Network</a></em> of researchers, scientists and curators. It will develop understanding within the cultural heritage sector of how location-based interfaces can be used to make collections meaningful, driving content-discovery beyond mere text-based searching and towards visualisation.</p><p>Thanks to various project partners and others, who may retain copyright in their respective sample datasets used in this software:</p><ul dir=\"auto\"><li><a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">English Heritage</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.HistoricEngland.org.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Historic England</a> - contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2020.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.historicenvironment.scot/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Historic Environment Scotland</a> - Scottish Charity No. SC045925 © Crown copyright and database right 2020.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.hrp.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Historic Royal Palaces</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.mola.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Museum of London Archaeology</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The National Trust</a> - Registered Charity in England &amp; Wales No. 205846</li><li><a href=\"https://finds.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Portable Antiquities Scheme</a> - linked images Courtesy of the Portable Antiquities Scheme - © The British Museum.</li><li><a href=\"https://viaeregiae.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Viae Regiae</a> - a volunteer-driven member project of the Pelagios Network</li></ul>",

These pages either refer to the same visitor site, another location in the vicinity of the site or have another geographical connection. The map is therefore the beginning of a journey through the UK’s wealth of cultural heritage.</p><h2>What was involved in making the map</h2><p>VisitPlus was first shown to focus groups that were representative of the UK public to gain feedback. A powerpoint slide encapsulated the concept by focusing on the National Trust’s and English Heritage’s visitor sites at Lindisfarne, asking the public if they would be interested in accessing connected records like the British Library’s Lindisfarne Gospels after a visit.</p><p>The reaction was positive as audiences appreciated that diverse and high quality resources were made accessible from a single point of access. The ‘VisitPlus’ branding was somewhat problematic however as audiences felt the name implied the map should only be used on-site and was an inadequate replacement for a guidebook. In short, the name obscured the broad range of use cases that were possible.</p><p>Underlying VisitPlus is a gazetteer of UK heritage visitor locations numbering in the low thousands and typically defined as of national significance. Each location acts as a nexus, an entry point to access many other collection items. Web pages were assigned coordinates in the form of latitude and longitude based on locations that they mention or represent. Connections were drawn computationally between those that were geographically close and that had similar names.</p>",

It depicts prominent locations including castles, bridges, and churches, providing a ‘tour’ of 17th-century landmarks and places of political importance around England and Wales.</b></big></p><p>Made by Wenceslaus Hollar in about 1660, it was perhaps intended to be bound with a future edition or reprint of Camden's <i>Britannia</i>. Camden's work was first published in 1586, a topographical and historical survey intended to \"restore antiquity to Britaine, and Britain to his antiquity\". The 1607 edition was the first to include county maps, which were drawn by John Speed and based on the work of Christopher Saxton in the 1570s. Saxton's astonishing maps can be seen online in the British Library's '<a target=\"_blank\"href=\"http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=royal_ms_18_d_iii_f006r\">Burghley Atlas</a>'.</p><p>Hollar's images are annotated with page numbers relating to the 1637 edition of <i>Britannia</i> indicating where descriptions of the places illustrated can be found.

These indicate a likely route taken by Hollar.</li><li>Use the search box at the top of the map to find <i>Nun Appleton</i> in Yorkshire. Examine Hollar's illustration of gravestones from the former priory there, and use the Related Records link to see the Historic England Listed Building entry for the country house built there in the late 17th century.</li><li>Look at Hollar's illustrations of castles: these can be found by filtering by 'Type', clicking on a filtered marker, and then clicking on the icon that appears over the image in the popup box. Can you identify any castles that appear to have been drawn before being slighted in the Civil War?</li></ul><h2>Dataset Preparation</h2><p>One of the challenges for this project was to provide a means of visualisation for datasets generated using <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://recogito.pelagios.org/\">Recogito</a>, which has become a standard tool for the annotation of images and texts in the GLAM sector (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums). Hollar's etching was first annotated and his drawings geolocated by David Cant and Sylvia Braisher (two volunteers working on the <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://viaeregiae.org/\">Viae Regiae</a> public history project). The resulting dataset was then enriched, using <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://britishlibrary.github.io/locating-a-national-collection/Locolligo.html\">Locolligo</a> to make additional links to type vocabularies, Wikipedia, and other online cultural heritage resources.</p>",
